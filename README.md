**Gameplay:**  

Generally your plan is to find the Initiation Portal and charge your clock for 60 seconds to advance to the next level.

On each stage there will be urns, chest and shrines waiting for you. Urns will grant you money, the two chest will drop you items for certain, and shrines are tricky. They have two activations for a very cheap but increasing price and the either drop or not. Let's spend your souls.

Dropped spells will dissapear in 10 seconds, so if you don't want to switch your current one out, just leave it be. ARCANE MINES ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED, SKIP THEM!

**Forging Runes:**  

In Addition the game can drop rune shard which you can spend by pressing "Select"/Enter and entering the forge menu. You can forge runes from rune shards enemies drop at random.  

**Runes:**  

Blood Rune: Increases health.   
Water rune: Life regen.  
Earth rune: Defense.  
Wind Rune: Movement speed.  
Thunder Rune: Damage  
Wave Rune: Attack speed (NOT IMPLEMENTED)  
Each cost 1 point to upgrade, and on each successful level you gain 4 shards!  

**Spells:**  

Fireball: Basic spell. One projectile, fast reloading.  
Flamelance: Piercing Spell!  
Spark: Will set enemies on fire! Stationary flame that will ignite enemies.  
Buzzsaw: Stationary damage dealer like spark.  
Lightning: Stun all enemies on screen, and damage them.  
Arcane Mine: Not Working!
